1) How to set a bit in the number 'num' : 
First we left shift '1' to n position via (1 << n)
Then, use 'OR' operator to set bit at that position.
'OR' operator is used because it will set the bit even if the bit is unset previously in binary representation of number 'num'.

2) Flipping the bits of a number: It can be done by a simple way, just simply subtract the number from the value obtained when all the bits are equal to 1 
Number : Given Number
Value  : A number with all bits set in given number.
Flipped number = Value â€“ Number.

Example : 
Number = 23,
Binary form: 10111;
After flipping digits number will be: 01000;
Value: 11111 = 31;

3) We can easily swap two numbers say a and b by using the XOR(^) operator by applying below operations:

a=a^b;
b=b^a;
a=a^b;

4) Given a number n , we can find the most significant bit in the given number by doing log2(N)

5) Given a number N, the task is to find the XOR of all numbers from 1 to N.
i) Find the reminder of N by moduling with it 4
ii) if rem=0, then the xor will be same as N
iii) if rem=1, then xor will be 1
iv) if rem=2,then xor will be N+1
v) if rem=3, then xor will be 0
